## explanations:

- The goal of the design was to 3D print it as a tool for blind children to learn about food utensils.
- The design was created by **Autodesk Fusion 360** computer software.

> It was my first project on fusion 360 to test it out after i was using only **SolidWorks**.
And i think it went very well!!
